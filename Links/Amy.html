	<p class="red">It's dark here. So deep. I feel the air particles of my body imploding. The pressure is starting to crush. But it's peaceful. Comfortable. Like a strong embrace of someone who missed you. How long have I been here, laying on the deep sands of the ocean, staring at the ever fading rays of sun that try to pierce the water to reach me? I don't know. I don't care. I feel like for the first time in awhile I can rest. </p>

	<p class="red">What happened? Have I fled? Was I sent here? Was I a coward or was I brave? What was my objective? I had someone. A Master. Someone that gave me motivation. Do I want that? Was it important? Was I important? Maybe I should care. What if people died because of me? What if they died for me? What's the purpose of my existence? Do I owe them something? Do they know me?</p>

	<p class="red">Breathe. It's fine. Close your eyes again. You can worry about it another time. Now sleep a bit more. Even if you don't know why, you know you deserve it. </p>
