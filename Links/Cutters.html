	<br /><u><b>Backstory:</b></u></p>
	
	<p class="red">Being a barber was what Cutter knew. Snip snap, all day. It paid the rent, and kept food on the table. It was also the most monotonous thing he had ever done. </p>

	<p class="red">One day a stray dog came by, his hair dirty, shaggy and unkept. Cutter had his trusty barber tools on him, and couldnâ€™t refuse such a loving creature. As the dog nibbled on a loaf of bread, Cutter began to clean and cut the dogs hair. It was different. Exciting really. Afterwards Cutter tried taking care of different animals in his free time, keeping them well groomed, and getting some mangy mutts adopted with their new look.</p>

	<p class="red">After a few months of this, Cutter decided he wanted to see what else was out there.  There must be bigger animals who need a good grooming. He was determined to find it. With just his barber tools and clothes on his back, he set out to see the world, and make it more beautiful.</p>

	<p class="red">During his travels he saw a house which seemed in need of repair. Outside if it was two shaggy horses and two sheep.  He decided to give them some food and water, while cleaning their fur and styling them up a bit. Hours later the owner of the house came back, and had two bodyguards with him. Happy to greet them, Cutter finished the grooming before turning to shake the owners hand.  He was met with a swift punch to the gut and a pointed sword at his face. "Horse thief" he was called.  Pleading his case it went unheard, as circumstance was against him and his word meant nothing in this area.  He was thrown in prison, where his real story begins.</p>
