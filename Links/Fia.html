	<br /><u><b>Backstory:</b></u></p>
	<p class="red">I grew up in Deepwood, I was found by my adoptive mother after I was abandoned by my real parents, and grew up with my older sister and two younger brothers in a grove named “The Circle of Willows”. Our mother died when I was 60 and two of my siblings never treated me the same, my youngest brother and me were still very close. When I was 90 I was framed by my sister and brother for killing Silver, my youngest brother wolf, and her pups. My little brother believed them, but since there was no evidence, instead of getting sentenced, I got excommunicated by the grove and was told to never come back.</p>

	<p class="red">Years past by and now I have a small room in Seth where I live with my pet cat, her name is Layla, and my small white dog named Ari, which means silver in elvish in memory of my youngest brothers wolf. I make jewelry for a living, and sell it at the local trade. I am friendly with my neighbors, and I’ve had my fair share of partners (man and woman) but I never stay for long in a relationship or have meaningful friendships because it’s hard for me to trust people.</p>

	<p class="red">Since I grew up in a druid grove, I really love animals, and even though my grove outcasted me I still find their teachings important to me. I love nature and everything that comes with it. When I find an injured animal I will try to save it, that’s how I got my black cat Layla, she was injured bleeding on the road. I do find killing animals is cruel, but if its essential for our survivor I will do it, even if it will pain me greatly.</p>
