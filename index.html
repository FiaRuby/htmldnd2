   <h2><u>Adventures Fia had!</u></h2>
   
   <h3><u>First Adventure</u></h3>
   <p class="pink">One of my first adventures was in a haunted mansion! we had to solve puzzles and do a lot of crazy stuff! we found huge spiders in an attic and found keys in a coffer!</p>
   
   <h3><u>Second Adventure</u></h3>
   <p class="pink">Another adventure, we went to search for a girl. We found out she was working with mind flayers! Mind flayers are very scary, and at some point after we found the girl she took me and another friend to a secret place under the well, then we started to fight and her brain jumped out of her head! it was gruesome! but so cool!</p>

   <h3><u>Third Adventure</u></h3>
   <p class="pink">Then on an other adventure, we were looking for missing bodies, someone was stealing bodies. We found out that it was a group of necromancers that tried to protect their village with the undead they raised. Practicing necromancy in our world is extremely illegal and if we didn't stop them, the goverment would've killed all of them. At the end they only took the girl who was practicing necromancy and they promised to help.</p>
